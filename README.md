Playing with "Biologically plausible" neural network models. Such as Hebb/Anti-hebbian networks and reinforcement learning.

I'm not sure where this is heading yet, but I'm basing a lot of this on previous work by [Hu, Pehlevan & Chklovskii (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00690), [Pehlevan & Chklovskii (2014)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00680), [Pehlevan & Chklovskii (2014)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09468)

And Q-AGREL developed by [Pozzi, Boht√© & Roelfsema, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01768).
