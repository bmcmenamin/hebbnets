Demos for Hebb/Anti-hebbian networks

This folder has notebooks that give demos for how to use the Hebbian/AntiHebbian (HAH) networks.

* `Test extraction of top principal components.ipynb` shows that the Hebbian/AntiHebbian network with a single layer and neuron will learn the first principle components of a dataset

* `Test learning receptive fields from natural images.ipynb` shows that the Hebbian/AntiHebbian network with a single ReLU layer can learn localized receptive fields if fed a stream of natural images. Unlike previous work, these don't appear to be oriented Gabor patches, that's probably due to a misconfiguration on my end.
